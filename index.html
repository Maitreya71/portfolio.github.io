									I designed and deployed over 15 enterprise-level Power BI dashboards, significantly enhancing visibility into clinical KPIs such as patient wait times, readmission rates, and care quality metrics by more than 40%. 
									By conducting data quality assessments on over 20 million rows, I identified and resolved discrepancies that improved report accuracy by 25%.
									I analyzed key performance indicators like PMPM (cost per member per month), claims denial rates, patient satisfaction, and treatment adherence, which helped reduce hospital stay variance by 18%.
									Additionally, I developed models to identify high-cost members early, leading to a reduction in emergency visits and avoidable admissions and achieving over $850K in annual savings.
									I also trained and mentored a team of five junior BI developers, increasing overall BI team productivity by 30%.

									I led the migration of SAP data to Azure Data Lake storage and further into Azure Synapse Analytics,by integrating and transforming 15M+ records via Databricks and Azure Data Factory (ADF), improving data quality and scalability by 40%. 
									Designed and maintained optimized pipelines using SQL, ADF, and Databricks, cutting execution time by 25% and ETL workload time by 30%.
                                    Partnered with Business Analysts to translate complex supply chain and logistics requirements—including Master Data Document (MDD) specs—into robust SQL data models. Applied indexing, partitioning, and denormalization to boost query performance by 40%. Automated DDL/DML deployments with CI/CD pipelines, reducing workflow time by 20%.
                                    Built 20+ Power BI dashboards with DAX for KPIs like inventory turnover, forecast accuracy, and fill rate, driving a 30% increase in operational efficiency. Created warehouse throughput and route optimization dashboards, saving $950K in last-mile delivery costs. Vendor performance dashboards with automated alerts yielded $1.1M logistics savings. 
									Stockout monitoring reduced out-of-stock rates by 35%.
                                    Streamlined onboarding and training processes, cutting data prep time by 25%, and proactively resolved data-related issues to ensure smooth operations.

									As a Business Data Analyst, I led data pre-processing and transformation efforts using Tableau, importing over 2 million records from Azure to develop 10+ dashboards tracking key performance indicators (KPI) such as dispute rate and payment success rate, which improved decision-making by 30%.
									I collaborated with cross-functional teams to visualize critical fraud metrics—like fraud rate per 1,000 transactions and false positive rate—resulting in a 15% boost in detection accuracy and $900K in annual savings.
									Additionally, I tracked financial KPIs such as loan delinquency rates and asset performance, enhancing risk forecasts by 25%. I also built compliance monitoring dashboards that improved regulatory filing accuracy (to 99.2%) and reduced late submissions and audit escalations by 40% and 35%, respectively.
									Throughout the project, I maintained and nurtured over eight key stakeholder relationships to align business needs with data-driven solutions.
								</br> 
									<li>As a Data Analyst Intern, I analyzed e-commerce sales and supply chain data to optimize operations and identify abnormal trends.
									<li>I developed SQL Server queries to extract data from multiple sources, transforming it into Tableau dashboards to uncover trends and detect inventory stockouts, ultimately reducing processing time by 40%
