									I designed and deployed over 15 enterprise-level Power BI dashboards, significantly enhancing visibility into clinical KPIs such as patient wait times, readmission rates, and care quality metrics by more than 40%. 
									By conducting data quality assessments on over 20 million rows, I identified and resolved discrepancies that improved report accuracy by 25%. 
									I analyzed key performance indicators like PMPM (cost per member per month), claims denial rates, patient satisfaction, and treatment adherence, which helped reduce hospital stay variance by 18%.
									Additionally, I developed models to identify high-cost members early, leading to a reduction in emergency visits and avoidable admissions and achieving over $850K in annual savings.
									I also trained and mentored a team of five junior BI developers, increasing overall BI team productivity by 30%.

									I have successfully performed data migration from SAP sources to Azure SQL Data Warehouse, followed by ingestion, integration, and transformation of various tables using Databricks. 
									I have designed and maintained robust data pipelines using SQL, Azure Data Factory (ADF), and Databricks, optimizing data flow for efficiency and improved decision-making. 
									My expertise in developing complex SQL Server queries for ETL processes has streamlined data extraction, transformation, and loading into Azure SQL Warehouse, reducing workload time by 30%.
									I collaborated closely with Business Analysts to gather and translate complex supply chain and logistics requirements, including Master Data Document (MDD) specifications, into robust SQL data models and tables. 
									As part of a major data migration initiative, I cleaned, transformed, and integrated over 15 million records from disparate sources into Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) using ETL processes, improving data quality and scalability by 40%. 
									I also designed and implemented efficient pipelines in Azure Data Factory to trigger Databricks notebooks, which reduced execution time by 25%. 
									Through strategic use of SQL techniques—like indexing, partitioning, and denormalization—I optimized query performance by 40%.
									Additionally, I executed CI/CD pipelines to automate DDL and DML deployments, cutting workflow time by 20% while ensuring consistency across environments.
									To support data-driven decision-making, I extracted inventory, logistics, and sales data from Azure Data Lake and built over 20 Power BI dashboards using DAX, tracking key KPIs such as inventory turnover, forecast accuracy, and fill rate—resulting in a 30% boost in operational efficiency. 
									I created dashboards to monitor warehouse throughput, backorder volumes, and route planning, helping reduce last-mile delivery costs by \$950K. Vendor performance dashboards with automated refresh and alerts contributed to \$1.1M in logistics savings. I also implemented alert-driven stockout monitoring, reducing out-of-stock rates by 35%. 
									Beyond development, I orchestrated data workflows for onboarding and training new team members, reducing data preparation time by 25%, and regularly worked with stakeholders to troubleshoot and resolve data-related issues.

								margin-bottom: 16px;>As a Business Data Analyst, I led data pre-processing and transformation efforts using Tableau, importing over 2 million records from Azure to develop 10+ dashboards tracking key performance indicators (KPI) such as dispute rate and payment success rate, which improved decision-making by 30%.
									I collaborated with cross-functional teams to visualize critical fraud metrics—like fraud rate per 1,000 transactions and false positive rate—resulting in a 15% boost in detection accuracy and $900K in annual savings. 
									Additionally, I tracked financial KPIs such as loan delinquency rates and asset performance, enhancing risk forecasts by 25%. I also built compliance monitoring dashboards that improved regulatory filing accuracy (to 99.2%) and reduced late submissions and audit escalations by 40% and 35%, respectively. 
									Throughout the project, I maintained and nurtured over eight key stakeholder relationships to align business needs with data-driven solutions.
								</br> 
									As a Data Analyst Intern, I analyzed e-commerce sales and supply chain data to optimize operations and identify abnormal trends. 
									I developed SQL Server queries to extract data from multiple sources, transforming it into Tableau dashboards to uncover trends and detect inventory stockouts, ultimately reducing processing time by 40%
